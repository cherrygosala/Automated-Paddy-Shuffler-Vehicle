# Automated Paddy Shuffler Vehicle (APSV)

A smart agricultural robot designed to automate and optimize the paddy drying process. Developed as part of a real-time research project under the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, JNTUH-UCESTH.

---

## 🚜 Project Overview
Manual sun drying of paddy is labor-intensive, inconsistent, and susceptible to crop spoilage. The **Automated Paddy Shuffler Vehicle (APSV)** addresses these issues by automating the redistribution of paddy during drying.

> APSV aims to reduce drying time, improve grain quality, and reduce dependency on manual labor.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
- 80% of India's paddy is dried using open sun drying methods
- This leads to:
  - Uneven drying and grain spoilage
  - 5–7% weight loss
  - 10–20% drop in market value
  - Heavy labor requirement (4–6 people per acre)

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
- A semi-autonomous vehicle that shuffles paddy uniformly across the yard
- Controlled via a mobile app using Wi-Fi
- Includes obstacle detection, blade motor, and speed control

---

## 🛠️ Components Used
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32
- **Motors:** 4 Gear motors for movement, 1 Johnson motor for shuffling
- **Motor Control:** L298N Dual H-Bridge + 4-Channel Relay Module
- **Sensors:** HC-SR04 Ultrasonic for obstacle detection
- **Display:** I2C LCD (16x2)
- **Power:** 12V 14AH battery

---

## 🔄 System Workflow

Currently, the APSV is operational for forward and backward movement with the shuffler blade running in sync. Steering and obstacle detection modules are planned for future development.
